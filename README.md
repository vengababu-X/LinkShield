</p>

**LinkShield** is a lightweight web app that instantly tells you whether a link is **safe** or **trying to scam you**.  
Paste a URL. Click a button. Get a verdict.

No login.  
No tracking.  
No nonsense.

## 🚨 Why LinkShield Exists

Every day people lose money because of fake links like:

https://sbi.co.in.secure-login.net
https://paytm.com.verify-kyc.in 
https://amazon.in.refund-center.co

They *look* real.  
They are not.

LinkShield exposes these traps before you click them.

## ⚙️ How It Works

LinkShield uses real cybersecurity logic, not guessing.

It checks:

- **Real domain vs fake domain**
- **Brand impersonation**
- **Scam keywords** like `verify`, `login`, `kyc`, `refund`
- **Shortened URLs**
- **IP-based URLs**

If a site pretends to be SBI, Paytm, Amazon, etc but is hosted somewhere else, LinkShield catches it.

## 🧩 Why It’s Different

LinkShield does not check a database.  
It checks **how scammers build links**.

That means it can detect even **brand new scams** that no blacklist knows yet.

## 🧑‍💻 Creator

Built by **Xking**  
Because clicking unknown links is the modern version of walking into dark alleys.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

LinkShield gives **risk analysis**, not legal proof.  
If a link looks suspicious, do not click it.
